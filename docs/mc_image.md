# Rendering an image in Minecraft




The [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner) package makes it
possible to manipulate minecraft. Here I will illustrate one use of
this: reading in an image file and rendering it within minecraft as
blocks.

## Load and prepare an image file

First, let's download an image file from the web. We'll load it
directly into R from the web, using the
[imager](https://cran.r-project.org/package=imager) package.


```r
library(imager)
url <- paste0("https://bids.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles",
              "/300x300/public/karthik_ram.jpeg?itok=loiSP_tm")
img <- load.image(url)
```

Print to see the size of the image.


```r
img
```

```
## Image. Width: 300 pix Height: 300 pix Depth: 1 Colour channels: 3
```

The image is stored as a 4-dimensional array: horizontal and vertical
position, time, and color.


```r
dim(img)
```

```
## [1] 300 300   1   3
```

Let's convert it to grayscale, and make it 100x100.


```r
img <- grayscale(img)
img <- resize(img, 100, 100)
```

The level of gray is a number between 0 and 1. I'd like to coarsen
that to having 7 levels, which I can turn into different kinds of
minecraft blocks. I can use the R function `cut`.


```r
img[] <- cut(img, seq(0, 1, length.out=8))
```


## Render the image in Minecraft

Now let's load the [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner)
package and create a vector of different block types, from black to
white. We can use `find_item` to find the item IDs for these block
times. "Clay" has two possible item IDs; we'll take the first one.


```r
library(miner)
grayscale_blocks <- c("Black Wool", "Gray Wool", "Bedrock",
                     "Coal Ore", "Clay", "White Wool", "Iron Block")
grayscale_blocks <- do.call("rbind", lapply(grayscale_blocks,
                         function(a) find_item(a)[1,,drop=FALSE]))
```

Here's the result:


```r
grayscale_blocks
```

```
##           name id style
## 81  Black Wool 35    15
## 73   Gray Wool 35     7
## 26     Bedrock  7     0
## 36    Coal Ore 16     0
## 149       Clay 82     0
## 66  White Wool 35     0
## 95  Iron Block 42     0
```

Now, let's render that in Minecraft. We use `mc_connect()` to connect
to a minecraft server.


```r
mc_connect()
```

Let's find the "host" player position, and put the image 20 blocks
above his/her head. Actually, I'll hard-code it in here, so if I
re-run this it ends up in the same place.


```r
host_pos <- getPlayerPos()
host_pos[2] <- host_pos[2] + 20
```

Now, we render the image, with a nested `for` loop.


```r
for(i in 1:100) {
    for(j in 1:100) {
        setBlock(host_pos[1]+i, host_pos[2]+j, host_pos[3],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 2],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 3])
    }
}
```

Oops. that gives the image upside down and backwards. Let's fix that.


```r
for(i in 1:100) {
    for(j in 1:100) {
        setBlock(host_pos[1]+(101-i), host_pos[2]+(101-j), host_pos[3],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 2],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 3])
    }
}
```

The result looks like this:
