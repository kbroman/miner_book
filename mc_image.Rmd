# Rendering an image in Minecraft

```{r knitr_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```


The [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner) package makes it
possible to manipulate minecraft. Here I will illustrate one use of
this: reading in an image file and rendering it within minecraft as
blocks.

## Load and prepare an image file

First, let's download an image file from the web. We'll load it
directly into R from the web, using the
[imager](https://cran.r-project.org/package=imager) package.

```{r download_file}
library(imager)
url <- paste0("https://bids.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles",
              "/300x300/public/karthik_ram.jpeg?itok=loiSP_tm")
img <- load.image(url)
```

Print to see the size of the image.

```{r print_image}
img
```

The image is stored as a 4-dimensional array: horizontal and vertical
position, time, and color.

```{r dim_image}
dim(img)
```

Let's convert it to grayscale, and make it 100x100.

```{r make_gray_small}
img <- grayscale(img)
img <- resize(img, 100, 100)
```

The level of gray is a number between 0 and 1. I'd like to coarsen
that to having 7 levels, which I can turn into different kinds of
minecraft blocks. I can use the R function `cut`.

```{r reduce_to_7_gray_levels}
img[] <- cut(img, seq(0, 1, length.out=8))
```


## Render the image in Minecraft

Now let's load the [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner)
package and create a vector of different block types, from black to
white. We can use `find_item` to find the item IDs for these block
times. "Clay" has two possible item IDs; we'll take the first one.

```{r grayscale_blocks}
library(miner)
grayscale_blocks <- c("Black Wool", "Gray Wool", "Bedrock",
                     "Coal Ore", "Clay", "White Wool", "Iron Block")
grayscale_blocks <- do.call("rbind", lapply(grayscale_blocks,
                         function(a) find_item(a)[1,,drop=FALSE]))
```

Here's the result:

```{r print_grayscale_blocks}
grayscale_blocks
```

Now, let's render that in Minecraft. We use `mc_connect()` to connect
to a minecraft server.

```{r connect, eval=FALSE}
mc_connect()
```

Let's find the "host" player position, and put the image 20 blocks
above his/her head. Actually, I'll hard-code it in here, so if I
re-run this it ends up in the same place.

```{r host_pos, eval=FALSE}
host_pos <- getPlayerPos()
host_pos[2] <- host_pos[2] + 20
```

Now, we render the image, with a nested `for` loop.

```{r render_image, eval=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:100) {
    for(j in 1:100) {
        setBlock(host_pos[1]+i, host_pos[2]+j, host_pos[3],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 2],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 3])
    }
}
```

Oops. that gives the image upside down and backwards. Let's fix that.

```{r render_image_2, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:100) {
    for(j in 1:100) {
        setBlock(host_pos[1]+(101-i), host_pos[2]+(101-j), host_pos[3],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 2],
                 grayscale_blocks[img[i,j,1,1], 3])
    }
}
```

The result looks like this:
